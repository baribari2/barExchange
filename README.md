# barDex - A simple DEX 

***I'm still learning how to use git from the command line, so the folder structure in this project is atrocious (although it's not structured like this locally). The client/front-end is in the scripts folder for some reason if you'd like to take a look at that.***

This project is a simple DEX where users can swap `barTokens` for a predetermined ether conversion rate
